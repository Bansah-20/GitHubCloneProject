# Project: Git Branching Practice

Modification in main branch.

This is the description of my repo.

Modifications were made in both the `main` and `feature-greeting` branches.

This project practices:

- Creating branches for feature development
- Merging branches
- Resolving merge conflicts

It simulates a common collaborative workflow using Git and GitHub.
